# Building LLama Banker
Doing RAG for Finance using LLama2. Highly recommend you run this in a GPU accelerated environment. I used a A100-80GB GPU on Runpod.



# Startup 🚀
1. Clone this repo

2. Go into the directory `cd Llama2RAG`
3. Startup jupyter by running `jupyter lab` in a terminal or command prompt
4. Update the `auth_token` variable in the notebook. 
5. Hit `Ctrl + Enter` to run through the notebook! 
6. If you want to start up the streamlit app run `streamlit run app.py` (make sure you update your auth token in there as well!)
